# Illinois Schools 2017

I recently finished up a [script to analyze IL school data](https://github.com/daidado/daidado.github.io/blob/master/code/IL_schools/school_data.py). As I look through the data more, I hope to post some of my findings here.

## Diversity

Illinois public schools, by student, are still predominantly white: ![il_rc17_racial_breakdown](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/daidado/daidado.github.io/master/code/IL_schools/outfiles/il_rc17_racial_breakdown.png)
